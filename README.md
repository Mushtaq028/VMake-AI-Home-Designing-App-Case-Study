\## 🧠 Problem

Designing a home can be overwhelming for non-professionals.  

Traditional tools require technical expertise, long learning curves, and are often expensive.  

Users needed a tool that could help them \*\*express ideas easily\*\* and \*\*see realistic 3D outputs\*\* without requiring design knowledge.
